# ProxyKick (BungeeCord Plugin)

**ProxyKick** is a very basic [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) plugin which allows Minecraft server moderators (with ```proxykick.kick``` permission node) to **kick** players from the **entire bungee network**.

Initial localization strings (English and French) are available, to customize kick messages.

**ProxyKick.jar** is available in ```/target/ProxyKick.jar```.
